# MarkDownie's PDF Party

Welcome to MarkDownie's PDF Party - your easy to use Markdown to PDF converter.

## Frontend
![image](https://github.com/Simre1/missing-semester-project/assets/23276756/25ccfbd4-e228-4ff4-9e48-fa68eaf4c970)

To convert Markdown encoded text into a PDF, 
type or paste it into the editor on the left. 
Press then compile button (the one with the error in the center) to create a PDF out of the text, 
which gets then displayed on the right. 
As a special service, everytime you compile, 
a (harmless) surprise will happen to brighten up your day. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

On case custom styling is wanted, by using the pencil button (the one left to the compile button) a second editor for CSS input can be opened.
CSS styles need to target HTML elements, like `h1` or `p`.

### Used technology
The project is based on Svelte for the frontend and SvelteKit for the backend.

### Fonts
We used fonts available from Google Fonts (Inter, Londrina Shadow, and the Material Symbols), 
but we embedded them in our project, so that Google Servers are not called.
In the Acknowledgement section of our project, the Material Symbols are mentioned,
as the other fonts use 
[the SIL Open Font License (OFL) license](https://openfontlicense.org),
for which acknowledgements are not necessary.

## Backend

Send a POST request with the markdown content to `/api` to get a pdf back.

## Starting

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview` or start it in production with `node build/index.js`. If you are having issues with PhantomJS when running `node build/index.js`, use `OPENSSL_CONF=/dev/null node build/index.js`!


## Installation

To enable easy usage and installation MarkDownie's PDF Party is available as a Docker container. 

Just pull the container from `ghcr.io/simre1/missing-semester-project:release` and expose port 3000 to your network.
